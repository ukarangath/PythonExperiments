General README:
My experiments with Python. Might be useful for gearing up the intricacies of language
README for myself:
This folder has all the practise programming notes mentioned in "OneNote CP Store -> PYTHON Notes". These resources are either self created or PGDMLAI Python crash course related or NPTEL Python course related. For example, "Self_Sets" are the practise version of "Sets" original file obtained in respective section of PGDMLAI program, so the former fle would contain more practise materials compared to later one.
